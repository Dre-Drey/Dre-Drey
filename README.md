### Hi there !

You've found the place where I test things, make some mistakes and learn a lot, welcome :star2:

### Who I am

I'm Audrey (Drey) Doyen, PhD (in French : Dre) in Information and Communication Sciences and Anthropology. I used to work and teach at the University Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris) _on_ museums, but also worked _with_ a lot of museums and national and international cultural institutions, as a freelancer and the cofounder of a consulting agency/association (yes, both can match together and it's great).
I'm deeply involved in issues like access, sustainable development and equality both in my professional and personal life.
I switched to programmation because I'm a problem solver, I love learning (remember the thesis), and I need new challenges !

### What I do

- :sunflower: I'm currently learning Javascript (Vanilla, better learn to swim in the pool before diving in the ocean), Html and Css.
- ❄ I'm discovering React and about to be a big fan.. But I'd like to give a change to Vue.js !
- :rocket: I'm making a website to know more about space, using APIs (mostly from NASA) and libraries to do data visualization.
- ⚡ I'm a Git enthousiast : yes, it's weird but I love Git & Github.
- :book: My retraining is quite a journey, so I document it through my [blog](https://audreydoyen.com/), which is also a great sandbox for testing some html/css and React (next.js)

### What I'm proud of

- of the collective projects I've done at school, which show the diversity of my learning and my flexibility: notably Wonderflower, a flower sales platform in MERN and [Touiter](https://github.com/Dre-Drey/reseau-social-php), a social network in PHP.
- of the projects I manage to launch alone, to challenge myself, like my blog or [Blabla Broderies](https://github.com/Dre-Drey/BlablaBroderies). 
- of the fact that I dare to develop with developers who are much more experienced than I am, it's from them that I learn the most!
- Finally, this year, I'm proud to have taken on the [Advent of code challenge](https://github.com/Dre-Drey/Advent-of-Code) after only 2 months of coding. I stopped at day 5, but happy to discuss it and do it again next year !!

### What I dream about

- Of learning more about cybersecurity
- Of finding a great company to do my apprenticeship in June 2023
- Of building tools that help people

Do no hesitate to [contact me](mailto:au.doyen@gmail.com) if you have some advice, I love to chat !
