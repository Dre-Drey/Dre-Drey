### Hi there !

You've found the place where I test things, make some mistakes and learn a lot, welcome :star2:

### Who I am

I'm Audrey (Drey), PhD (in French : Dre) in Information and Communication Sciences and Anthropology. I used to work and teach at the University Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris) _on_ museums, but also worked _with_ a lot of museums and national and international cultural institutions, as a freelancer and the cofounder of a consulting agency/association (yes, both can match together and it's great).
I'm deeply involved in issues like access, sustainable development and equality both in my professional and personal life.
I switched to programmation because I'm a problem solver, I love learning (remember the thesis), and I love challenges !

### What I do

- :running: I'm a proud dev apprentice at [FizzUp](https://conseils.fizzup.com/a-propos/), where I develop the backend of the app in Laravel and the web part of the activities in Nextjs.
- :rocket: I love datavizualisation, so I'm learning D3 and play a lot with bubbles and donuts... which I use in my blog and sides projects.
- âš¡ I'm a Git enthousiast : yes, it's weird but I love Git & Github.
- :book: My retraining is quite a journey, so I document it through my [blog](https://audreydoyen.com/), which is also a great sandbox for testing lot of stuffs.

### What I'm proud of

- of the collective projects I've done at school, which show the diversity of my learning and my flexibility: notably Wonderflower, a flower sales platform in MERN and [Touiter](https://github.com/Dre-Drey/reseau-social-php), a social network in PHP.
- of the projects I manage to launch alone, to challenge myself, like my blog or the period tracker I'm making for my diploma. 
- of the fact that I dare to develop with developers who are much more experienced than I am, it's from them that I learn the most!
- of the challenges I keep taking on, like the Advent of Code.

### What I dream about

- Of having the courage to speak in a meetup and share my experience with some more experimented developpers
- Of making the tech great again: a tech for all, built by diverse people.
- Of learning more about security

Do no hesitate to [contact me](mailto:au.doyen@gmail.com) if you have some advice, I love to chat !
