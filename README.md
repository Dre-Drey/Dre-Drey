### Hi there !

You've found the place where I test things, make some mistakes and learn a lot, welcome :star2:

### Who I am

I'm Audrey (Drey), PhD (in French : Dre) in Information and Communication Sciences and Anthropology. I used to work and teach at the University Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris) _on_ museums, but also worked _with_ a lot of museums and national and international cultural institutions, as a freelancer and the cofounder of a consulting agency/association (yes, both can match together and it's great).
I'm deeply involved in issues like access, sustainable development and equality both in my professional and personal life.
I switched to programmation because I'm a problem solver, I love learning (remember the thesis), and I love challenges !

### What I do

- :running: I'm a proud dev at [FizzUp](https://conseils.fizzup.com/a-propos/), where I develop the backend of the app in Laravel and the web part of the activities in Nextjs.
- :rocket: I love datavizualisation, so I'm learning D3 and play a lot with bubbles and donuts... which I use in my blog and sides projects.
- âš¡ I'm a Git enthousiast : yes, it's weird but I love Git & Github.
- :book: I really like writing : I therefore share my interests, my advice and my learnings on my [blog](https://audreydoyen.com/), which is also a great sandbox for testing lot of stuffs.

### Current interest
- I have phases during which I am deeply interested in a subject. Right now, it's browsers. If you want to discuss V8, I am here, please, be a nerd with me.

### What I'm proud of

- of all my projects : lauched alone or with other (great) developers. They keep me up to date and bring me lots of fun. Take a look on my public repositories or on my blog. Don't hesitate to contact me if you want to build something !
- the 2 talks I gave at Google and Eleven Lab, to share my knowledge with other devs. Find the talks on my site or ping me ! 
- of the fact that I dare to develop with developers who are much more experienced than I am, it's from them that I learn the most!
- of the challenges I keep taking on, like the Advent of Code.

### What I dream about

- Of making the tech great again: a tech for all, built by diverse people.

Do no hesitate to [contact me](mailto:au.doyen@gmail.com) if you have some advice, I love to chat !
