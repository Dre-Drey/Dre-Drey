### Hi there !

You found the place I test things, make some mistakes and learn a lot, welcome :star2:

### Who I am
I'm Audrey (Drey) Doyen, PhD (in French : Dre) in Information and Communication Sciences and Anthropology. I used to work and teach at the University Sorbonne Nouvelle (Paris) *on* museums, but also worked *with* a lot of museums and national and international cultural institutions, as freelance and cofounder of an consulting agency/association (yes, both can match together and it's great).
I'm deeply involved in issues like access, sustainable development and equality both in my professional and personal life.
I switched to programmation because I'm a problem solver, I love learning (remember the thesis), and I need new challenges !

### What I do
- :sunflower: I'm currently learning Javascript (Vanilla, better learn to swim in the pool before diving in the ocean), Html and Css. 
- :rocket: I'm currently making a website to know more about space, using APIs (mostly from NASA).
- âš¡ I'm a Git enthousiast : yes, it's weird but I love Git & Github.
- :book: My retraining is quite a journey, so I document it through my [blog](https://dre-drey.github.io/), which is also a great sandbox for testing some html/css

### What I dream about
- Of learning more about cybersecurity
- Of finding a great company to do my apprenticeship in June 2023
- Of building tools that help people

Do no hesitate to [contact me](mailto:au.doyen@gmail.com) if you have some advices, I love to chat !
